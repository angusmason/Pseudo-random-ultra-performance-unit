# Pseudo Random Ultra Performance Unit

## Inspiration

This has been a project which I've been wanting to work on for a while now. It's been close to my heart and I'm so happy now that I've finally been able to make some time in my life to start.

## Important Info

Includes a switch-mode monitored voltage-controlled-attenuator and a neural network blockchain machine learning model using the advanced multilayer encryption algorithm with the sha256 scrambling hash rotation quaternion solver.

Also the vector matrix movement relativity solver is now working properly.
