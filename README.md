Includes a switch-mode monitored voltage-controlled-attenuator and a neural network blockchain machine learning model using the advanced multilayer encryption algorithm with the sha256 scrambling hash rotation quaternion solver.

Also the vector matrix movement relativity solver is now working properly.
